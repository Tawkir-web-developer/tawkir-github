        <br><p>Delwar Hossain Sayeedi was a Bangladeshi Islamist leader, politician, public speaker, and convicted war criminal, who served as a Member of Parliament representing the Pirojpur-1 constituency from 1996 to 2006</p>
        <p>In 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh found him guilty on eight out of twenty counts, which included murder, rape, and religious persecution. The verdict, which condemned him to death, generated significant domestic and international attention, leading to both support and criticism.[6][7][8] The verdict subsequently led to public protests and clashes between his supporters, opponents, and law enforcement agencies, resulting in a series of riots and unrest.</p>
